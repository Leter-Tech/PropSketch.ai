## üéØ **Inspiration**

Property design is a complex process ‚Äî starting with ideas on paper and ending with fully realized structures. But bringing those ideas to life takes time, tools, and often expensive software.

**What if AI could transform a sketch into a full digital design ‚Äî complete with materials, walkthrough videos, and shareable outputs ‚Äî in seconds?** What if design became more intuitive and faster?

**PropSketch.ai** was created to empower architects, designers, and developers to focus on creativity, not complexity. By combining **cutting-edge AI tools** with a streamlined interface, PropSketch.ai helps you **visualize, refine, and present your designs effortlessly** ‚Äî from napkin sketch to polished proposal.

This is property design reimagined ‚Äî faster, smarter, and neater.
